## COURSE DESCRIPTION

__*Internet Geographies*__ The internet, like many technologies, is often claimed to possess the power to collapse time and space. As emphasis is placed on the capacity of communication networks to erase distance, the physicality of the internet itself tends to disappear from public view and public concern. At the same time, the internet and digital technologies have enabled expanded access to tools for seeing and comprehending the physical world, through web mapping tools and satellite imagery resources. 

This class will introduce students to code-based tools for creating web maps such as Javascript, Leaflet, D3, and Mapshaper. We will focus on visualizing data concerning physical infrastructures central to the internet. 

Discussion and reading will explore various ways that infrastructure occupies, transforms, and is transformed by its material environments. Coursework for this seminar will include programming exercises and projects. No prior coding experience is required.

## COURSE STRUCTURE
Our course will be organized as a hybrid theory/practice seminar, meaning that your coursework will be comprised of both the kind of textual engagement (reading and writing) typical of a liberal arts seminar, as
well as hands-on work building and making examples of the objects and technologies that we will be reading about. Typically we will spend Mondays discussing the readings, screenings, examples, and concepts of
that week. Wednesdays will usually (but not always) be dedicated to project work: I will lead a technical tutorial during class time and will often supplement this with online materials (video or lecture notes) that you can refer back to when you are working on technical projects after class. See the course schedule below for daily plans, and always check the website for any changes or updates.

## EVALUATION & GRADING

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final paper/project. It is understood that this course will be technically and conceptually challenging, therefore your effort, curiosity, and engagement is of utmost importance.

## GRADE CALCULATION:

Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 15% Reading Responses
* 15% Discussion Lead
* 5% Small Assignments
* 30% Technical Projects
    * 15% Project 1
    * 15% Project 2
* 25% Final Project/Paper
* TOTAL: 100%

## EXPECTATIONS AND WORKLOAD
You can expect to have a few assigned readings and or videos to watch each week (these are marked as readings underneath each Monday class heading - any resources marked optional are not mandatory but are typically relevant and quite informative.) You must complete all readings prior to class, and come ready to participate in discussion. Details for how to submit assignments will be given in class.

## READING RESPONSES
Starting in week 2, choose five readings from anywhere in the syllabus and write a 250-word reading response to each. Upload your response to the shared class google doc by 11pm the night before the next Monday class to give everyone else enough time to read your work! Reading responses are discussion aids to be shared with the class. These responses are to demonstrate your engagement with the course material. You may choose to write about a specific passage or image in the reading, compare the reading to previous readings, or perhaps even diagram the structure of the argument.

## DISCUSSION LEAD

During our first meeting, you will sign up to co-lead two reading discussions of your choice. For each Monday meeting thereafter, I will begin by mapping out the week's theme within a broader field, cultural context, or contemporary debate, highlighting key interventions and implications. Your team will then follow with a 20-minute presentation involving close readings and analysis of the text/s. In your presentation, please (1) specify key figures and keywords, (2) draw out main arguments and structure, (3) note methods and sources used, and (4) finally, raise discussion points/questions, and/or a class exercise. Kindly email me your presentation outline by 7pm the day before.

**Addendum**: There are a few weeks where full books will be assigned for reading. During those weeks the expectation will be that everyone reads the introduction and conclusion. I will then assign each reading group a chapter to read. During the following class's meeting each group will give a brief (5-10 minute) presentation on their assigned chapter of the book so the class will cumulatively have a grasp of major themes of the work. 

## THIS SYLLABUS IS IN FLUX

And it will probably remain so for the rest of the course. I expect things to change as we get a sense of our shared goals, and an ideal pace of learning. The material covered in this course consists of both formal academic scholarship and more informal works and resources. As such I will treat this syllabus as a living document in which shared resources will be archived and made accessible to those in the class and any other curious parties. Please check in here regularly.

## COURSE HYBRIDITY

This semester is strange! We will be spending the first few weeks online and then the rest of the semester in person. As such, I want to give some clarity around expectations and leniencies for hybrid learning. It is expected for situations to arise where some of you will need mental health days, get sick, are exposed to a covid positive person or even get covid (I hope not but you never know). When this happens and you are unable to attend class that is completely fine! Your health and wellness are more important than a single class. That being said, I won't be leading any hybrid classes, i.e having a zoom session run for some students to be remotely learning while in person class is going on. If you miss class for any reason I am more than happy to schedule extended office hours to go over course material from either of that week's classes.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

* Understand what core infrastructures make up the internet and how they affect the fundamental nature of our technologically driven globe.
* Become familiar with the "art of noticing" and develop strategies to tune into generally overlooked details and components of internet infrastructure.
* learn basics of creating web maps using Leaflet, D3, and other tools (Inside or outside of Observable)
* practice collecting and geocoding spatial data
* Explore various kinds of media (artworks, documentaries, interactive maps, exhibitions) as a way to think through key concepts explored in this course.
* Read about different physical aspects of the internet.
* Conduct individual research and engage in group discussion on specific components of the physical internet.
* To be critical of the internet and its various workings.

## PROJECTS

The course is structured around **two technical projects**,  a few **small assignments**, and a  **final paper or project**. Each project is described in detail in the linked project brief pages.

Each project must be accompanied with a write-up detailing methodologies, resources utilized (can include technologies used, code pulled from elsewhere online, and anything that inspired you), setbacks, and documentation throughout the course of the project. This write-up is for me to get a sense of what the goal of the project was and to see what challenges you overcame while creating it. Feel free to use whatever tool you are most comfortable with for the write-up. For instance if you have a website and want to create a blog for each project that's great! You can also submit a word doc or PDF if you prefer. On days that projects are due we will plan on spending the first 30-45 minutes of class presenting projects and giving constructive group feedback on them.

## LATE ASSIGNMENTS

The general policy is that **late assignments will not be reviewed**.

As such, here are my general suggestions for working on projects and assignments (in this class and beyond):

- 1. **Always have something to show**: While developing your projects, always have a "minimum reviewable unit" that speaks to your project concept. Even if your project doesn't technically "work", you should always have something to present.
- 2. **Submit on time and refine**: Submit what you have on time. If you followed suggestion #1 above, then you'll have material to discuss and explain where you're at and where you're trying to go. You can always refine and update what you have even after the deadline, but if you have nothing to show, then your effort cannot be evaluated and improved.

## IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE LAND

Each day at The New School and every session of this course, we are gathered on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded Indigenous land of the Lenape and Canarsie peoples. I ask you to join me in acknowledging the Lenape and Canarsie communities, their elders both past and present, and their future generations. I acknowledge that whether intentionally or through ignorance, The New School was founded upon exclusions and erasures of many Indigenous peoples, including those on whose land this institution is located.

This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to reckoning with the history of the land upon which we are gathered and beginning the process of working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism. 

We start this process through building our own awareness and appreciation for the land we are able to live, work, and play on and integrating these awarenesses into the art we make, the tools we build, and the work we do. 

References: [Jer Thorp's Land Notice](https://github.com/blprnt/DataPublics#land-notice) & [Native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/territory-acknowledgement/)


## NEW SCHOOL MASK POLICY
The New School has implemented policies and guidance intended to support the health and safety of the
university community. Mask wearing protects others, not just the wearer. All students, faculty and staff are
asked to respect our entire community by abiding by university policies at any given time. New School
community members who observe others not abiding by these expectations may gently remind them to
respect our community health.

## UNIVERSITY & COLLEGE POLICIES

Academic honesty, plagiarism … and computer programming
Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one
or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary
probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and
must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their
work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures
specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others.
The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found at http://www.newschool.edu/policies/

Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the Learning Center’s website:
http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/avoiding-plagiarism.pdf

All of that said, software development work and coding almost always involve the appropriation and
collaging of other people’s code. Learning computer programming often entails modifying working
examples rather than starting from scratch. In this class we are participating in communities of shared
practices. However, any work you borrow and/or modify must be labeled as such. If you find sample code
and integrate it into your work, this must be clearly and obviously indicated as such. You can use comments
in your code and/or your lab notes. You will not be graded down for integrating other people’s work into
your own. In fact, integrating the code of others is often more challenging than writing your own. However,
I wish to review and comment on the work that you do, so this must be clearly indicated. Failure to do so
will be considered the same as any other breach of academic integrity.

## INCLUSION & RESPECT

The following is modified from The New School’s declaration on maintaining a safe and respectful learning
environment: In this class we are dedicated to creating a welcoming environment for all members of the
university community inclusive of race, ethnicity, national origin, culture, language, gender and gender
expression, sexuality, religious and political beliefs, age, and ability. We’ll aim to celebrate our diversity and
to respectfully negotiate differences in experience, understanding, and expression. We will stand against
all forms of discrimination and oppression, whether directed against individuals or groups. We will also
make an effort to respect one another’s individuality in our forms of address, which includes learning one
another’s names and pronouns.

If you experience anything in the classroom that undermines these values – or if there is anything that I can
do to better cultivate inclusivity and respect – please feel free to let me know. Likewise, if you are facing
personal challenges inside or outside the classroom that are impacting your class performance, I’m happy
to speak with you about strategies of accommodation, and to help you find the appropriate support
resources at the university. (This text is appropriated from Ingrid Burrington, who appropriated it from Professor Rory Solomon, who appropriated it from Professor Shannon Mattern.)

## STUDENT COURSE RATINGS

During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide feedback for each of their
courses through an online survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining
to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It
is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a
course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for
feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are
most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without
this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and
course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys.
