## COURSE PROJECT

Throughout the semester we have covered a variety of topics related to and tangentially related to the internet and its complex entanglement of people, industries, and legacies. You should begin to think about a fluid, capacious **research topic, related to our course material, that you’d like to explore through a critical lens**. This research will culminate in either:
1. a 2,000- to 3,000-word paper (word count includes end-matter), or 
2. A creative/production project (that’s of final-project-appropriate scope) with a 600-word accompanying text, in which you address the critical and/or aesthetic issues you aimed to explore through your work, explain how your chosen format aided in that exploration, and provide a bibliography listing the critical resources that informed the project.
This research project is worth 15% of your final grade, and is due before class on **May 16**, our final meeting.

## DEADLINES

| Item | Week | Deadline |
| :----    | ---- | ---- | 
| Written Proposal | Week 11 |  April 6 |
| 1-on-1 Check-ins | Week 13 - Week 14 |  N/A |
| Final Project Presentation | Week 16 |  May 16 |

## PROPOSAL
### This Proposal is required for both project based finals and for paper based finals
You’ll need to submit a 600-word (max., or otherwise substantial) proposal for this project, via the [Google Forms Submission Form](https://forms.gle/wt9oFr43rDjjK8nAA). 

This proposal should include:

1. a topic description, thematic overview, problem statement, or research question that pertains to material we have covered in this course. 
2. a discussion of your topic’s relevance to the course material, larger critical or political significance, timeliness, etc.
3. a preliminary discussion of how your topic might lend itself to investigation as it pertains to the course material (i.e., **what can you learn by mapping it or researching it**?).
4. a description of the geographic area(s) and scale(s) you plan to focus on in your paper/project. 
5. **IF WORKING ON A PROJECT** What tools, format, datasets etc you plan on using?
6. a tentative bibliography of **at least five sources** (some scholarly publications, some popular publications, some precedent maps, etc.) that will likely prove useful in your research and practice. 
7. Are you working on a project or paper? **You have the freedom to change direction but I require a rewritten proposal in that case**

### PROGRESS

You will be expected to meet with me *at least* once between submitting the project proposal and the end of the semester to discuss your project. There will be a time alloted during class in mid April for us to meet. 

**Optional:**
* You are encouraged to schedule time to chat outside of the required times for a 15-min check-in.

## SUBMISSION

Please do not email me five separate files or five separate links, or hand me five separate documents; **your final submission should be one integrated collection, with all components synthesized and contextualized.** If your work consists of analog, performative, or ephemeral media that doesn’t readily lend itself to submission, you’ll need to share with me some coherent form of documentation. 

You’ll submit your project **before the start of the final class on May 16**, and during that class each student will deliver a presentation/documentation of their work. 

## FAQ

### What makes a successful final?

A successful final project will:
1. **Showcase substantial effort and thoughtfulness in data collection, research, and mapping**
   - **Quality**: Was your data collection done in a meticulous, rigorous, and/or careful manner? Was your data well organized? 
   - **Understanding**: Based on your collected data and documentation, was it clear that your mapping efforts were done thoughtfully. Your data collection should engage critical themes mentioned or discussed in the class such as those around ethics, infrastructure criticality, privacy, social/environmental justice. 
   - **Application**: More data is not necessarily better. What is important is that your collection is substantial and/or substantive to provide materials for discussion. Ultimately: were your collection methods appropriately applied?
2. **Educate your peers**
   - **Quality**: Did you make enough effort to synthesize and summarize your work such that others can engage with your focal point?
   - **Understanding**: Were you able to successfully synthesize and summarize your findings? 
   - **Application**: Were you able to create, collect, and make sense of materials - in the form of your projects and primary and secondary research - in coherent and appropriate manner? How well were you able to employ the [Implosion Methodology](https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/ca29.2.09/301) to understand your subject.
3. **Surprise and delight**
   - **Quality**: Did you make an effort to prepare your materials in a manner that expresses care for how your peers and audience will experience your research?
   - **Understanding**: Did you engage with your focal point enough to arrive at potentially new perspectives? 
   - **Application**: Did you go beyond the given code examples? Did you inject your personality or style into the work in any way? 

A successful final paper will have many of the same criteria with the emphasis instead being on expanded research into a thematic area of course material which you find most interesting and would like to delve deeper into.
