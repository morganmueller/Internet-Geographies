# Project 2 Data Storytelling 

> " In order to successfully participate in this emerging digital reality, it’s imperative that [those] internet users have the skill of digital literacy. If we don’t highlight the importance of knowing and understanding our devices and how they interact with our data, we’re in danger of creating and reproducing inequalities and privileging some people with greater access and abilities than others." - Mimi Onuoha, 2015

## Background
Up to this point in the course we looked at a variety of mapping projects that explored how creative data processing pipelines could lead to intriguing geographic applications and spatial reimaginings. We will take this week to explore some of our own creative data processes/processings to continue our mapping practice.
