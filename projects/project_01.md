# PROJECT 1: Mapping a Public Dataset


## Background
Familiarity with multiple tools is critical for creating web maps and programming in general. While one tool may be great at a certain task, another tool could be great at a different one.
We're going to practice getting comfortable with multiple mapping tools and using publically accessible data!



## Brief
The purpose of this first assignment is to get you comfortable with four things:
1. Developing a workflow for prototyping and creating web maps (and visualizing data in general!)
2. Using a few basic web mapping tools in combination with each other
3. Finding, cleaning, and using publically available data
4. Visualizing that found data on a map with additional styling and interactive layering


## Step-by-Step

* Step 1: Get the data
    * Using one of the resources below, or one of your choosing, search for a publically available dataset that interests you.
    * Do any cleaning or geoprocessing that needs to be done in order for that data to be ready to map.
    * This can be done in turf.js or another geoprocessing tool 
        * __NOTE: If you have to do any data processing my recommendation is to first try yourself but I am also available to assist!__
    * __MAKE SURE TO ONLY USE .GEOJSON DATA FOR LEAFLET, NOT .CSV OR REGULAR .JSON__
* Step 2: Assess the data you have and what you want to achieve with it.
    * It is important to think about what you want your data to say, or not to say.
    * The type of map you choose will affect how the data is read and understood
    * If you are choosing a map where color is a key factor think about how colors matter in representing data. This is also important for making sure data visualizations are clear for the visually impaired.
* Step 3: Start Mapping with Leaflet.js
    * Use Leaflet.js to create the first map
    * Iterate on the style in Leaflet if you would like!
* Step 4: Translate your map from Leaflet.js to either D3.js or [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/).
* **Extra Credit** * Translate the map using a third tool.
    * You can try d3.js
    * Or you can try [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/?product=Mapbox+GL+JS)



## Project Write Up and Submission

### 
Submission Link: [https://forms.gle/1XrGDEWKerD7DcrJ9](https://forms.gle/1XrGDEWKerD7DcrJ9)

**Your final submission should be one integrated collection, with all components synthesized and contextualized.**

Make sure to document your process as you find and clean/convert data, map it, and add interaction to it. Justify your reason for creating the type of visualization you chose (points, chloropleth, heat map etc.) and why the data you mapped was interesting to you. Detail the technical steps you took to go from purely being interested in a topic to having a full fledged map of it.

Add screenshots of your maps and any other assets which may help me to get a feel for your work.

In your write up please make sure to link 
1. All javascript, html, css, and data files you used.
2. Locations you pulled data from
3. Any external resources you used.

Please make sure to zip all associated data and programming files and add them into a shared folder with your project write up. Then give me access to that link in your submission.
