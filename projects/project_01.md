# PROJECT 1: Mapping a Public Dataset

## Background
Familiarity with multiple tools is critical for creating web maps and programming in general. While one tool may be great at a certain task, another tool could be great at a different one.




## Brief
The purpose of this first assignment is to get you comfortable with four things:
1. Developing a workflow for prototyping and creating web maps (and visualizing data in general!)
2. Using a few basic web mapping tools in combination with each other
3. Finding, cleaning, and using publically available data
4. Visualizing that scraped data on a map with additional styling and interactive layering 


## Step-by-Step

* Step 1: Get the data
    * Using one of the resources below, or one of your choosing, search for a publically available dataset that interests you.
    * Do any cleaning or geoprocessing that needs to be done in order for that data to be ready to map.
    * This can be done in turf.js or another geoprocessing tool 
        * __NOTE: If you have to do any data processing my recommendation is to first try yourself but I am also available to assist!__
* Step 2: Assess the data you have and what you want to achieve with it.
    * It is important to think about what you want your data to say, or not to say.
    * The type of map you choose will affect how the data is read and understood
    * If you are choosing a map where color is a key factor think about how colors matter in representing data. This is also important for making sure data visualizations are clear for the visually impaired.
* Step 3: Start Mapping with Leaflet.js
    * Use Leaflet.js to create the first map
    * Iterate on the style in Leaflet if you would like!
* Step 4: Translate your map from Leaflet.js to either D3.js or MapboxGLSL.
