# Week 14 - Waste & Disposal

> "Most e-waste stories, intentionally or otherwise, reinforce the idea that individual consumer responsibility is where the action ought to be. However, when it comes to electronics, consumers can buy things like cellphones and choose from a myriad array of makes, models, and features. But the conditions under which those electronics are made, the amalgams of toxicants they contain, and the scale of waste and pollutants arising during raw material extraction and manufacturing are so similar and so vast as to make the idea of ‘consumer choice’ basically meaningless as a waste prevention strategy. " - Lepawsky

**Small Assignment**
This is a kind of art of noticing assignment with a few divergences.
For this small assignemnt you are tasked with keeping an eye out for anything you may deem 
'e-waste' from now until next Monday's class. This could be 'e-waste' you see while walking around the city or waste in your apartment! Take a photo of the ewaste and catalog it. Out of all the e-waste you find choose one of the pieces of e-waste and research it. In your research process try to find potential routes that the different components of the e-waste could take to either reuse or landfill!

Come prepared to talk about your discoveries in class on Monday (pictures are a very welcome addition)
