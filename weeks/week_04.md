# Week 4 - Scales, Spatialization, & Sensing

> “This desire to open the black box of infrastructure, to expand the visual vocabulary' plays into the Dark Cloud’s own paradigms of surveillance. What do we achieve by watching the watchers?” ― Amoore (2015)

> "Being planetary as praxis is a way to engage with the planetary-human joins that might also be re-imagined." - Gabrys (2018)

> "Yet the contemporary Cloud chasers, while conscientiously self-reflexive about their identities as artist-researchers, sometimes fail to publicly address the broader politics of their performance." - Mattern (2016)
