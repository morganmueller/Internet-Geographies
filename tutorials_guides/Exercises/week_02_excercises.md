# Javascript Exercises

 The goal of this problem set is to get you comfortable with the basic elements of programming in Javascript. try not to google for answer to the problem but instead, if you need assistance, try searching for details on how different components work and see if that can assist you. I would recommend using the Mozilla developer documentation for assistance. Linked [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)



1. What data types are the following variable

- `let val1 = 25.5;`
- `let val2 = 30;`
- `let isComplete = false;`
- `let testVal;`

2. Use a conditional to set the value of the `testVal` variable to be true if the `isComplete` variable is `false`.

3. How many characters are in the following string?
> 'Vision in this technological feast becomes unregulated gluttony; all seems not just mythically about the god trick of seeing everything from nowhere, but to have put the myth into ordinary practice. And like the god trick, this eye fucks the world to make techno-monsters.'

4. 3) Create an array of the words in the above string. Name the array `parArray`. 

4. How many words are in the array?

5. What is the 10th word in the array?


6. Lookup the value for `movie` in the `movieDir` object literal.

```js

movieDir = {
    director: 'Harun Farocki',
    movie: 'Still Life',
    date: '1997'
};
```

7. Add a `length` property to the `movieDir` object with a value of `58`.


8. Create a function called `converter()` that will convert from Celsius to Farenheit.

9. Loop through the following array and print out each value in it. Try using a regular `for` loop and a `for of` loop

`const dogBreeds = ['Malamute', 'Akita', 'Terrier', 'Irish Wolfhound', 'Vizsla', 'Kelpie', 'Saint Bernard', 'Shiba Inu', 'Shih Tzu'];`

10. __BONUS__: Loop through the `dogBreeds` array and create a new array with the dogs listed in alphabetical order. Note this will require a higher order array method that we didn't cover! Check out the mozilla docs for help: [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

11. __BONUS__: revisit the `converter()` function from question 9 and write it as an arrow function.
