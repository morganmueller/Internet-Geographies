## About
[Mapbox Studio](https://studio.mapbox.com/) is the Mapbox application for managing your geospatial data and designing custom map styles. Use Mapbox Studio to build and design a map to your exact specifications by uploading and editing your own data, utilizing Mapbox-provided tilesets, adding custom fonts and icons, or refining the built-in template map styles. With Mapbox Studio, full data management and design control are at your fingertips.

## Before you start

In order to export maps, you'll need your own Mapbox API key. To get a Mapbox API key you can [Sign up with Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You can learn more about how [Mapbox API keys work here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/).
